1 Step
Develop a project architecture with three subdirectories: Ð¡ore, infrastructure, and Presentation.
Presentation will accept WepApi and transfer it to the core.
Infrastructure will work with the database.
Core will process requests. 

I will build the database on SqlLite using the code-first principle. Connection via EntityFramework, where I will separately write the configuration for possible future scaling or changes.
